# Required Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_THIRDWEB_CLIENT_ID=""        # Your thirdweb client ID (from thirdweb dashboard)
NEXT_PUBLIC_THIRDWEB_AUTH_DOMAIN=""      # Your app's domain (e.g., "localhost:3000" for development)
THIRDWEB_AUTH_PRIVATE_KEY=""             # Your wallet's private key for auth server (KEEP THIS SECURE!)

# Contract Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=""          # Your AGOD token contract address on Sepolia

# Optional Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_OPENZEPPELIN_URL=""          # OpenZeppelin relayer URL for gasless transactions (optional)

# Development Notes:
# 1. For local development:
#    - Set NEXT_PUBLIC_THIRDWEB_AUTH_DOMAIN to "localhost:3000"
#    - Make sure your thirdweb client ID has localhost:3000 in allowed domains
#
# 2. For production:
#    - Set NEXT_PUBLIC_THIRDWEB_AUTH_DOMAIN to your actual domain
#    - Update allowed domains in thirdweb dashboard
#
# 3. The THIRDWEB_AUTH_PRIVATE_KEY should be from a wallet:
#    - With sufficient funds for auth operations
#    - That you control and keep secure
#    - Never commit this to version control!

# Security Notes:
# - Add .env to your .gitignore
# - Keep your private key secure
# - Only share client-side env vars with NEXT_PUBLIC_ prefix
